                <p class="over">&nbsp; &nbsp; I didn't perposfuly volunteer to help volunteer. I like helping. It's just something I like doing. So, when I was in fith grade and the teacher asked if we wanted to help the little second graders learn to read I happily volunteered to help. I would always help my mom and the PTA set up for school events and then I'd help tare everything down before we went home. Even after I've graduated elementary school something just keeps dragging me back to help. Even now every time we go back to my elementary school I help with the set up and take down of events.</p>
            <div class="detail">
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Like I stated above, in fith grade, every wensday one of the second grade classes would come in and all the fith graders would pare up with a second grader and help them read. I found this to be a fun experience and I enjoyed having the opertunity to work with those kids at a young age and help them learn to read.</p>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I also help the PTA a lot. Northridge Elementary does many different school activities such as their yearly school carnival, a school dance, fun run, family fun nights, choir concerts, ballroom prefomances, and sixth grade graduation at the end of the year. When ever I can I like to help out.</p>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In my sixth grade year I also helped make, edit and distribute the school's yearbook. My mom and I worked on this project together. We had to go through making sure we had all the kids photos and names. We also had to make sure we had the correct name to face for all the students, facitaly and staff. We then had to show it to the teachers to make sure we had everything correct. We also made several pages of pictures that had been colected from school activities throughout the year. We then sent it to the printing people. When we got it back we make sure everything was correct, then we collected payment slips ordered the books. When they came I helped my mom distribute the yearbooks to all the classes.</p>

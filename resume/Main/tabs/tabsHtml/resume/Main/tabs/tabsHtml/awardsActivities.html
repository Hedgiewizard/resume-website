                <p class="over">&nbsp; &nbsp; I love doing ballroom dance. I have been doing ballroom dance for five years now. I did it at my elementary school, Northridge; middle school, Oak Canyon Jr High; and at Island Style, a personal studio. I placed 1st at Gem State Classic, Placed Bronze at BYU; Performed at UVU, Lakeridge High School, Timpanogos High School, Pleasant Grove High, Northridge Elementary and danced in parades.</p>
            <div class="detail">
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At Northridge I did ballroom for two years. I competed in many compititions there as well.</p>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At Oak Canyon I was on the level two dance team for two years. On this team I competd at several different compititions. We also preformed at Timpanogos High School.</p>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At Island Style I was on a showdance team for a year. On that team we went to Gem State Classic and one 1st place.</p>

                <p class="subHead">SheTech Internship</p>
                    <p class="over">&nbsp; &nbsp; Over the Summer of 2019 I had many great Experiences. One of which was I had the opertunity to be apart of the SheTech internship program. Durring this internship we went to several different tech companies in Utha and learned about woman in code. It was a really good experience and hope to go further with SheTech.</p>
                    <div class="detail">
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The different companies we went to with SheTech were Sofi, Health Catalyst, Adobe, Ancestry, Progressive Leasing, Dell EMC, Qualtrics, Skill Struck, Domo, IM Flash, and Vivint. Visiting all of these companies was spread out across the span of two weeks.</p>
                   <!--- 
                   <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Week one we went to Sofi, Health Catalyst, Adobe, Ancestry, Progressive Leasing and Dell EMC. </p>
                   <div class="muchDetail">
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Day one we went to Sofi and Health Catalyst. We first went to Sofi. They are an online banking company. Sofi helps with student loan refinancing, mortgages and personal loans. They also allow you to invest in stock. They told us about themselfs, about their workspace and gave us a tour. After Sofi we went to Health Catalyst. Health Catalyst is a leading provider of data and analytics technology and services to healthcare organizations, committed to being the catalyst for massive, measurable, data-informed healthcare improvement. They told us what they do and gave us some history.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Day two we went to Adobe and Ancestry. Adobe is an American software company. Officially known as Adobe Systems, the company is known for its multimedia and creativity software products. While at Adobe we went on a tour, learned about them, learned what some of their enploies thought of Adobe and met and talked with some of the enploies. Ancestry is a new DNA testing service that utilizes some of the latest autosomal testing technology to revolutionize the way you discover your family history. It feels like they also work with companies such as 23andMe.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Day three we went to Progressive Leasing and Dell EMC. Progressive Leasing provides a no credit needed lease purchase option for credit challenged consumers. While we were there we went on a tour of the building and then we split into groups and learned what positions they have and what they do. We also did some problem solving activities. Dell EMC is an American multinational technology company that offers products and services across all areas of computing, networking and storage. At Dell EMC we learned about making our own personal brand, went on a tour of the building and learned more about the jobs in the tech indistries.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Week two we went to Qualtrics, Skill Struck, Domo, IM Flash, and Vivint. We also did a film segment on Friday of that week.</p>
                        <div class="muchDetail">
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On day four we went to Qualtrics and Skill Struck. With the other days we went to two different locations. On this day we only went to one. We went to Qualtrics and then Skill Struck came to Qualtrics and presented to us there. From what I'm understanding Qualtrics is a company that helps take surveys. Qualtrics software enables users to do many kinds of online data collection and analysis including market research, customer satisfaction and loyalty, product and concept testing, employee evaluations and website feedback. Skill Struck is a website that will help people learn to code. Qualtrics showed us how their surveys worked, taught us a little bit about how their company was started and gave us a tour of their building. Skill Struck came and taught us what they do and taught us some basic HTML and CSS. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Day five we went to Domo and IM Flash. We first went to IM Flash. IM Flash produces 3D XPoint used in data centers and high end computers. They make little waffers that store data. While we were there we learned about their company, learned how they made their chips and we got to see the fab(where they make the chips). Next we went to Domo. is a cloud-based platform designed to provide direct, simplified, real-time access to business data for decision makers across the company with minimal IT involvement. While we were there we learned about what they did, got a preveiw of their service and learned from some of their woman enpoies. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On day six and at last day we only went to one company but eariler that morning we had a news promotional. We had the news promotional early in the morning and visited vivint that afternoon. Vivint is a private smart home services provider in the United States and Canada. They make sicuritiy devices to help you protect your home. While at Vivint we learned about their products and did a coding activity.</p>

                        <p class="over">&nbsp; &nbsp; I have been in two school musicals so far. I was in one at Northridge and one at Oak Canyon. At Northridge we did Susical the Musical and at Oak Canyon we did The Music man. For both musicals we had to make out own costumes. For both musicals I ended up in the ensamble, I had to memorise several songs and retunies for several different dances. They were great experiences and I'm probably going to sign up for another Musical some time in high school.</p>

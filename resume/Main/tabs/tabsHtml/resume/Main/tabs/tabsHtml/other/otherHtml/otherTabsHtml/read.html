As long as they could remember they played with toys together and served the queen, the china doll in Poppy's house. They wish they could play forever... But times have changed... They have changed... They are growing up.... <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  But disaster strikes when, without warning, Zach’s father throws out all his toys, declaring he’s too old for them. Zach is furious, confused and embarrassed. He can't admit he lost them. Deciding that the only way to cope is to stop playing . . . and stop being friends with Poppy and Alice.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Then one night the girls decide to pay him a visit... but they say not by choice. They tell Zack about the series of mysterious occurrences, bad dreams... terrible nightmares... visions... from the queen? <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Poppy swears she is now being haunted by a china doll - who claims that she is made of the ground-up bones of a murdered girl. Poppy tells them that they have to return the doll from where she came from and burry her or else the doll will curse them for eternity....</p>

Libby drew the pictures, May wrote the tales, and their heroine, Princess X, slayed all the dragons and scaled all the mountains their imaginations could conjure. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once upon a few years later, Libby was in the car with her mom, driving across the Ballard Bridge on a rainy night. When the car went over the side, Libby passed away, and Princess X died with her.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once upon a now: May is sixteen and lonely, wandering the streets of Seattle, when she sees a sticker slapped in a corner window.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Princess X? <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; When May looks around, she sees the Princess everywhere: Stickers. Patches. Graffiti. She couldn't beleive she had missed it. There's an entire underground culture, focused around a webcomic at IAmPrincessX.com. The more May explores the webcomic, the more she sees disturbing similarities between Libby's story and Princess X online. And that means that only one person could have started this phenomenon---her best friend, Libby, who lives. </p>
